            <p>
                My name is Asia H-Bey I am a beginner Software developer. This is a change of career for me 
                as I have worked primarily as an Insurance Agent or a Behavioral Health Specialist off and on 
                for the past 20 years with different focuses or specialties in each field. You can get more
                information about my career experience if you click on the text above the images below.
          
                I would like to spend my last years before I retire in the technology field. I feel like it's extremely important to 
                stay up on the trends and to keep up with technology the best that one can being as though it's 
                moving at an extremely fast pace. I beleieve taking on the basic skills of coding, along with becoming
                skilled in front-end and back-end development will keep me employable. I also beleieve IT will keep
                my mind sharp by doing so because to stay up to date I will have to continue learning for the rest of my life.
                
            
                In my free time I like to exercise, take care of plants, spend time with my children, make crafts with wire and resin, and watch a good 
                TV series. Currently my favorites are The Sandman, His Dark Materials, Boruto and Stranger Things. I am also a huge Star Trek fan.</p>
